# Java
Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).

The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.

## Where it is used

According to Sun, 3 billion devices run java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus etc.
2. Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com etc.
3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
4. Mobile
5. Embedded System
6. Smart Card
7. Robotics
8. Games etc.

## Types of Java Applications

There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using java programming:

**1) Standalone Application**
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Example of standalone applications are: Media player, antivirus etc. AWT and Swing are used in java for creating standalone applications.

**2) Web Application**
An application that runs on the server side and creates dynamic page, is called web application. Currently, servlet, jsp, struts, spring, hibernate, jsf etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in java.

**3) Enterprise Application**
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications etc. is called enterprise application. It has the advantage of high level security, load balancing and clustering. In java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

**4) Mobile Application**
An application that is created for mobile devices. Currently Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
